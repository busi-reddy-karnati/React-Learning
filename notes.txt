React isn't a framework

React is component based : most important part

Create app: 
            npx create-react-app my-app
            cd my-app
            npm start: starts the development server

Folder Structure:
    node_modeules has all the node dependencies
    src is where your code goes
    public has an html file that has root 
    package.json has information about installed packages

You can only return one component from a component
1. Delete everything in src(one-hello-world) and start from scratch
2. include an index.js and create a basic app(index.js is default)
3. Let us add CSS
    1. You can add style for independent element
        style = {{textAlign:"center"}} Notice there are no -. We use Camel Case instead
    2. Create style.css
        write plain simple css here
        eg.body{
            background:#343434
        }

        Now import that
        import "./style.css"

        Giving class in JSX is different
        className="className"
4. Lets us move App code to another file App.js(create)
    to import App, we should mention export default App in the botton
    import App from "./App"

Curly braces demands return statement but () don't
<Component param1="param1", param2="param2"/>

Props are the parameters that were passed
props are synonymous for properties
props used to pass data from one component to another

 Since components are scattered around, to manage the variables of a class and variable, we use state
 A central place to fetch data from


 Never update the State variable directly
 
 Tictac toe explains: 
    Conditional Rendering, third party 
    We also use React icons, reactstrap(Bootstrap for React), Toastify
    Separate Components into folders

    Checking winning logic: There are 8 conditions: 3 horizontal checks, 3 vertical checks, 2 diagonal checks


Context API
This is used for Centralised State
Before we used to have Redux. Now we have Context API


Redux was used for Centralised State Management
    Let's say I have A parent, A child and a Grandchild. Parent passes the props to the child but the child doesn't use that and passes that to 
    grand child to be used. Instead of doing that, We can directly pass these without prop drilling, passing the props explicitly to every level
