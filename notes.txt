React isn't a framework

React is component based : most important part

Create app: 
            npx create-react-app my-app
            cd my-app
            npm start: starts the development server

Folder Structure:
    node_modeules has all the node dependencies
    src is where your code goes
    public has an html file that has root 
    package.json has information about installed packages

You can only return one component from a component
1. Delete everything in src(one-hello-world) and start from scratch
2. include an index.js and create a basic app(index.js is default)
3. Let us add CSS
    1. You can add style for independent element
        style = {{textAlign:"center"}} Notice there are no -. We use Camel Case instead
    2. Create style.css
        write plain simple css here
        eg.body{
            background:#343434
        }

        Now import that
        import "./style.css"

        Giving class in JSX is different
        className="className"
4. Lets us move App code to another file App.js(create)
    to import App, we should mention export default App in the botton
    import App from "./App"
