Steps for creating a redux app
    1. Define a Store
    2. Define Actions
    3. Create a reducer
    4. Setup the Store

1. Design the store
    npm i redux
    {
        bugs{
            array of bugs, each with id, description, resolved
        }
        currentUser:{}
    }

2. Define Actions
    1. Add a bugs
    2. Mark a bug as resolved
    3. Delete a bug

3. Create a Reducer
reducer.js

4. Setup Store
store.js

Subscribing to the store
If we subscribe, after every change in state, this is executed
store.subscribe(()=>{
    log(store.getState)
})

Make constatns in one place
We should also create actions to dispatch diferent action so that there is a single place

{hhandleSubmit } is from props. Catch it in forms
