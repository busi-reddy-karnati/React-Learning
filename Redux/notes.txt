Just a state management library
Can use with React, Angular, Vue etc

If you want to change one component based on the other. 
And components can be complexly linked

Redux is inspired by Flux

Redux is used to manage state centrally in an environment.
Let's say there are 10 components and all of them can affect how the others are rendered.
If you keep passing data and triggering changes for every action, that is going to make it complex
To make that easy, Redux stores the information centrally called "Store"
It makes data flow transparent and we can also figure out what, where and when it went wrong

Classic example is a shopping cart. If we add an object, the cart should update and UI should change
This can be possible with Redux. Because Redux has a central store of data and every object derives properties from there
Pros:
    Predictable output and flow of data
    Centralised and easy to manage
    Easy to debug 
Cons:
    Complexity of code: Redux relies on Functional programming principles and that can be daunting at first
    Verbose: Redux can be pretty Verbose

Functional Programming concepts
FP is one of the Programming paradigms. 
Consists of Functions that do one simple thing
Functions as First-Class-Citizens
    Assign to a variable,
    pass as an argument,
    return from other Functions
