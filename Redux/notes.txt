Just a state management library
Can use with React, Angular, Vue etc

If you want to change one component based on the other. 
And components can be complexly linked

Redux is inspired by Flux

Redux is used to manage state centrally in an environment.
Let's say there are 10 components and all of them can affect how the others are rendered.
If you keep passing data and triggering changes for every action, that is going to make it complex
To make that easy, Redux stores the information centrally called "Store"
It makes data flow transparent and we can also figure out what, where and when it went wrong

Classic example is a shopping cart. If we add an object, the cart should update and UI should change
This can be possible with Redux. Because Redux has a central store of data and every object derives properties from there
Pros:
    Predictable output and flow of data
    Centralised and easy to manage
    Easy to debug 
Cons:
    Complexity of code: Redux relies on Functional programming principles and that can be daunting at first
    Verbose: Redux can be pretty Verbose

Functional Programming concepts
FP is one of the Programming paradigms. 
Consists of Functions that do one simple thing
Functions as First-Class-Citizens
    Assign to a variable,
    pass as an argument,
    return from other Functions



Higher Order Function
    A function that takes a function as an argument, or returns a function
    setTimeOut for example is a Higher Order Function
    It accepts a function to be executed after a certain interval
    And each function can be of many types. Defined in different ways
function sayHello() {
  console.log('Hello World!')
}

function functionHellO() {
  return function () {
    return 'Hello World'
  }
}
let fn = sayHello
fn()

let fn2 = functionHellO()
let message = fn2()
console.log(message);


Functional Composition
Each component/function can be used inside another
We can break down large chunks of data into smaller ones
And Use a chain of functions f1(f2(f3()))
Same this is pipe(f3,f2,f1) references not calls
Or compose(f1,f2,f3)
const transform = pipe(f3,f2,f1)
transform(input)
But let's say f1 needs more arguments than what f2 outputs, 


But that looks messy, we can infact modify the said expression
We use lodash to do that

Pure functions:
    This is when given input always give the same output
    Don't have date, random values, etc
    Don't rely on gloabl variables
    Benefits:
        Self documenting
        Easily testable 
        Concurency
        cacheble(Like
         DP)yyyyyuyional Programming, everything is immutable
But objects in JS aren't immutable. 
Strings, const variables  
Redux shouldn't mutate data as it can cause global state to change

 
Enforcing Immutabiltiy: Since JS doesn't give immutability, we can use 
Libraies:
    immutable
    immer

    ===============================Redux===============================
Redux's main feature is store which stores the global state.
Store is an immutable object, we need to use special methods to update the data stored in a store
Reducer is used to update the store. ideally each property to be changed should need a Reducer

Syntax 
reducer(store, action){
    action is the event that occurs for this reduces to be fired
    reducers are like handlers for actions
    updated;
}

actions are dispactched to the store. The store using reducer modifies the store
